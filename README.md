This an Android Project I created for a University course.

## The Idea

It is a storage management app where a user can track their inventory by adding/subtracting from it using the barcode of the product. It is very easy to use and offers a lot of features, making inventory management extremely easy for companies and for personal use.

## Inital design

## Notes

The app was connected to Firebase but I removed the Firebase Project, so if you wish to run the app on your phone you have to connect it to your Firebase.
